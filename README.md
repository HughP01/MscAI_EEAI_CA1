# Overview
A Hugh Plunkett and Natalia Ellen Nicholas production\
This project builds upon an architecture provided by our module coordinator that enables the chaining of dependent variables for predictive modeling with the goal of classifing email types.



# Usage
The architecture can be extended to other models beyond RandomForest or alternate data sets as long as they are of the appropiate format.
