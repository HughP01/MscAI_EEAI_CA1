# Overview
A Hugh Plunkett and Natalia Ellen Nicholas production\
This project builds upon an architecture provided by our module coordinator that enables the chaining of dependent variables for predictive modeling with the goal of classifying email types.

# Running the Code

To execute the chaining architecture, run the python file : main.py \
Ensure that all required dependencies are installed before execution \
Note: All dependencies can be found in the file requirements.txt


# Usage
The architecture can be extended to other models beyond RandomForest or alternate data sets as long as they are of the appropriate format.
